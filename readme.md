# To Change an Astromer's Mind

## Description
The cosmological paradigm has been stagnant since the addition of the dark energy constant in the 1990â€™s. Stage-IV surveys promise to measure different properties of our Universe to unprecedented precision. However, it is not clear that these new measurements will be enough to meaningfully change our understanding of the cosmos. Whether the new generation of facilities will deliver on their implicit goal is not only a function of their precision but also of how surprising their results will be, meaning how different said results will be from our current understanding. One can imagine that an unremarkable result will require an exceptional precision to become remarkable while a remarkable one would still be exceptional even at unremarkable precision.  In this project we will investigate the interplay of these two factors in the context of current  and future surveys. In order to do so, the student will make extensive use of Bayesian statistics and information theory. The results of this project will be important guidelines to inform what scientific goals should be pursued in the future given the likelihood of high-impact outcomes. A student that undertakes this project will gain highly-transferable skills in Bayesian statistics and computational methods as well as great knowledge of the cosmology literature. 

## Goals
For the time being, let's focus on the potential of future surveys to change our knowledge on dark energy comparing the Dark energy Survey (DES), the Euclid mission and LSST.
